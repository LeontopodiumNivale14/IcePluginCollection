     * Just a place for me to jot down my notes so I don't lose them
     * Something to consider... I can't particularly have a full path non-stop. It would get problematic making sure that it interacts with the target
     * So maybe a fix would be 
     * -> Create a class that takes multiple things
     *   -> Vector3 (for waypoints)
     *   -> TargetId for interacting
     * Something to consider
     * -> One way to handle this is make a series of linking paths
     *   -> if target exist, then interact/gather
     *   -> if target doesn't exist, continue onto the next route

### âžœ What is this?
A plugin that is to be used alongside visland/vnavmesh to help you level/gather everything on your little private island. From leveling you from Lv. 5 -> 20, to being able to maximize the amount of items you have while also keeping your workshop inventory.

### What modes does it have?
1: Leveling mode/Cowries grind
- You can select between two different routes to grind from.
- Clay | Sand (Ground XP Loop) & Quartz Route (Flying XP Looop) !! Currently have to be lv. 5 and unlocked the shovel before you can use this, but working on making it work from lv. 4 and above
- Both are the most optimal that you can do depending on your level/if you have unlocked flying on your island. (Quartz is the best route to farm, but can only start doing that at Lv. 10+)
- Did I mention that you can also input your workshop values, and it will make sure to keep the amount of items that you've inputted, while adjusting the amount of loops that it can do!
- Also a good farm for <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df366124-1406-4504-b1b5-1d17efdfc276" width="20">, allowing you to build up for hi-cordials or materia's for gathering/crafting.

2: Gather select routes
- You're able to select which routes you want to farm from, and let it go! It will take you to the shop, sell the required amount of items, and proceed to farm the route till you hit maximum capacity/potentional. 
- All routes have workshop values that you can input, so if you want to keep Stone for your workshop, you're able to input that and it will adjust how many it can do.

### Why create this to begin with?
This was my first code that I actually wrote in LUA... 1? 2 years ago? Man it's been awhile. But even with island sanctuary being moreso on the dead side due to new content coming out in Dawntrail, there's still people that need to level up/wants to get all the glam/items. And this was a fun code experience in itself. I do hope you all enjoy it and happy gathering.

### Planned things I still want to update with this:  
-> Smooth out pathing between leaving the shop to heading to the gather destination  
-> Add an extra route for if you're Lv. 4+ and you don't have the shovel unlocked yet.   
-> Add a teleport to Island Sanctuary button (that way you can just directly TP there)

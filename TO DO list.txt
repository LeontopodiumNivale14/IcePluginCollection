// things I want to do post update (Thanks @Croizat for the actual ideas)

// Add a feature to buy cordials based on amount of cowries earned (moreso top priority)
// "Shopping List" or moreso setting an amount of items you want to gather from each loop, that way it can calculate how many to do.
// Improve routing to the sections
  // By this i mean use navmesh entirely instead of relying on visland for waypoints
  // to the same degree, add a flying version for each of the routes
// Need to check to see if you can check if flying is unlocked or not...
